# Multiple PDFs QueryBot

The **Multi-Files QueryBot** is a Python-based tool that allows users to interact with multiple document types, including `PDFs`, `.docx`, and `.json` files, through natural language queries. Users can ask questions based on the content of these documents, and the app provides accurate, context-aware responses.\n* Itâ€™s designed to help users efficiently navigate and extract insights from large sets of documents, training them to ask more effective and precise questions.

## How it works?

The application follows these steps to respond to your questions:

- **Files Loading**: The app reads multiple documents and extracts their text content.
- **Text Chunking**: The extracted text is divided into smaller, manageable chunks for efficient processing.
- **Language Model**: The application employs a language model to create vector representations (embeddings) of the text chunks.
- **Similarity Matching**: When a question is asked, the app compares it to the text chunks and identifies those with the highest semantic similarity.
- **Response Generation**: The selected chunks are input into the language model, which generates a response based on the relevant content from the PDFs.
